# PROG 2007 - Assignment 1
Variables, Operations, and Loops  
PROG 2007: Programming II  
**Due as posted in Brightspace**

## Task
Write a C program that conforms to the requirements listed below:

### Requirements:

- Generate a printed table of the form N*N for values of N=1 to 10 for
  both the rows and the columns. That is, 1 is at the top, left in both
  directions. Use some variant of for loop(s) for this component

- The table should be a square layout, NxN

- The table should have a header line showing each value of N for a column

- Generate and print the table values using nested loops

- Print a reversed variant of the table with 10 at the top, left. Again
  with a header line. Use some variant of while loops for this
  component

- Include clear comments

- Maintain a standard layout/format for the code. Be consistent with
  spacing or tabbing, use the layout to make nested operation visually
  clear.

**NOTE: Do not delete or move the included original-table-sample.txt and reversed-table-sample.txt files as they are required for the tests.**

### Sample Outputs:
The original table output should look something like this:

The reversed table output should look something like this:

## Submission Instructions
### Video Recording Submission:

You will demonstrate the completion of this project via a **video screen-capture recording** of you using CLion, GitBash, and viewing your code to show completion of the **Video Submission Checklist**, which is posted on Brightspace. You will post **either your video file or a link to it** (e.g. a Microsoft Stream recording, make sure to give the instructor permissions to watch it), to the Brightspace Assignment 1 Dropbox prior to the deadline. If you are not sure of how best to capture such a video, seek advice from the instructor prior to the deadline.

NOTE: MAKE SURE TO SHOW EVERYTHING IN THE VIDEO SUBMISSION CHECKLIST STEP-BY-STEP. YOU WILL NEED AUDIO IN THE VIDEO FOR AT LEAST THE CODE REVIEW PORTION OF THE CHECKLIST

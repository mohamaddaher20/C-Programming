# PROG 2007 - Exercise 5

## Task

Using my grades arrays examples from the previous video as a guide:

**Ask the user to enter the typical 6 grades for an NSCC term and store them in a one-dimensional array. If they entered 6 good grades, output the term average grade value to one decimal place. Then ask the user for a grade number to display and retrieve and print that value from the array. Do NOT refer to the first grade as "Grade 0" as users do not need to know our arrays start at zero.**

At any point, if the user enters a grade that is negative or greater than 100, output the correct message and return an error code of 1.

**NOTE:** It would be good to use a **preprocessor macro definition** for the size of the array.

### Sample outputs:

Sample of erroneous negative number input:

Sample of erroneous "too high" input:

Sample of proper input:

### Instructions:
-   Clone this repository to your local machine, make changes in CLion so all tests pass, and then commit and push the entire project up to GitHub
-   You should then be able to see your raw score on GitHub out of 10 as shown in class. The final grade will depend on the time of submission, see below:

#### Marking Scheme
Final Grade | Requirement
:---: | ---
|**10/10** | Exercise is correct (passes all tests) and is completed within the allotted in-class time.
|**8/10** | Exercise is correct (passes all tests) and is completed within a 12-hour grace period beginning immediately following the end of in-class time.
|**6/10** | Exercise is correct (passes all tests) and is completed and submitted after the 12-hour grace period has elapsed.
|**0/10** | Exercise is not submitted or does not pass all tests.

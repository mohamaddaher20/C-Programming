# PROG 2007 - Exercise 10

## Task

We will simply use a pointer to a struct to populate the struct with data and output it. We will then debug some code that should use a pointer.

### STEPS:
You have already been provided with both a "**src/main.c**" and "**inc/studentRecord.h**" file. The studentRecord.h file already contains a definition for the Student struct. The main.c file already links in the header file and creates a basic struct variable.

**Now, implement the code marked by "TODO's" in main.c.**

**NOTE**: Make sure to use a pointer to a struct to do the tasks in the first three TODO's.

**NOTE**: Uncomment and debug the block of code after the last TODO. Make sure to use the variable with "**pointer**" in the name as a proper pointer.

### Sample outputs:

### Instructions:
-   Clone this repository to your local machine, make changes in CLion so all tests pass, and then commit and push the entire project up to GitHub
-   You should then be able to see your raw score on GitHub out of 10 as shown in class. The final grade will depend on the time of submission, see below:

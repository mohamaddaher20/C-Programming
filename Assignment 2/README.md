# PROG 2007 - Assignment 2
Conditionals, Arrays and Functions  
PROG 2007: Programming II  
**Due as posted in Brightspace**

## Task
Write a C program that conforms to the requirements listed below:

### Requirements:

#### Part 1:
- Create a Boolean function to determine if a year passed to the function is a leap year and pass back a Boolean result.

#### Part 2:
- Prompt the user to enter a date. Validate that it is a number that represents a year (no characters, no floating point, no negative numbers, etc.)

- Validate if the date is a leap year and inform the user of the result

- Prompt the user to continue with another year.

- Loop, prompting for more years, until the user enters the letter ‘N’ to indicate they wish to stop. Be clear in your prompt that this is the terminating condition.

#### Part 3:
- Generate a Boolean table representing all of the years from 1 to 2022. Determine which years are leap years and which are not, storing the true/false results in the Boolean table.

- Print only the leap years, one century per line.

#### General requirements:
- You will need to put your function to determine whether a year is a leap year in its **own source file called leapyear.c**

- You will have a function prototype declaration for that function mentioned above in a **header file called leapyear.h**

- All your source files (i.e. main.c and leapyear.c) should be in a **folder called “src”**

- Your header file (i.e. leapyear.h) should be in a **folder called “inc”**

- Include clear comments

- Maintain a standard layout/format for the code. Be consistent with spacing or tabbing, use the layout to make nested operation visually clear.

- Provide clear visual feedback to the user

### Sample Outputs:
Output showing only **4 centuries of Final Chart** (your output should show centuries up until the present year):

## Submission Instructions
### Video Recording Submission:

You will demonstrate the completion of this project via a **video screen-capture recording** of you using CLion, GitBash, and viewing your code to show completion of the **Video Submission Checklist**, which is posted on Brightspace. You will post **either your video file or a link to it** (e.g. a Microsoft Stream recording, make sure to give the instructor permissions to watch it), to the Brightspace Assignment 2 Dropbox prior to the deadline. If you are not sure of how best to capture such a video, seek advice from the instructor prior to the deadline.

NOTE: MAKE SURE TO SHOW EVERYTHING IN THE VIDEO SUBMISSION CHECKLIST STEP-BY-STEP. YOU WILL NEED AUDIO IN THE VIDEO FOR AT LEAST THE CODE REVIEW PORTION OF THE CHECKLIST

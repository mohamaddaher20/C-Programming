# PROG 2007 - Exercise 4

## Task
Using the program in example 4.7 (page 58) of the textbook as a guide:

**To calculate the Highest Common Divisor of two whole numbers, we must find the highest number which evenly divides both values.**

We will want to report appropriate errors and **return an error code** (use **1** to make tests pass) if zeros or negative numbers are entered.

If the program runs successfully (i.e. it did not error out as mentioned above), then prompt the user to continue entering new numbers to check.

### Sample outputs:

Sample of erroneous negative number input:

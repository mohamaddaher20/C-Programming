# PROG 2007 - Exercise 6

## Task

First take the code from our **leap.c** sample file in the **Resources for the Making  Decisions lecture** and **refactor it into a function** that returns true or false if a passed  in year is a leap year or not.

Call it from the main function to make sure it works.

Then create a **new function** that takes in the year and a numeric code for a month,   i.e. 1 = January, 2 = February, and so forth. Have it return the number of days in that month. **Make sure to make use of your new leap year function so you can correctly tell if February has 28 or 29 days that year**.

Also, return a message of "Bad year" if a year between 1 and 9999 not entered and return 1 error code.

Return a message of "Bad month" if a month between 1 and 12 not entered and return 1 error code.

**NOTE:** This would be a great job for a **switch-case** statement!!

**REMINDER:** "30 days has September, April, June, and November".

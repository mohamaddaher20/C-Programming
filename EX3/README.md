# PROG 2007 - Exercise 3

### Task
We can calculate a baseball player's **OBP** (On-base plus Slugging) Percentage  
using the following formula given here:  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage#Overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage#Overview)

We can calculate their **SLG** (Slugging Percentage) by the formula given here:  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage)

We can calculate their **OPS** (On-base Plus Slugging) by simply adding the OBP and SLG

Use these variable values (**Make sure to declare them as INT data types**):

At-bats: 600  
Hits: 200  
Singles: 124  
Doubles: 40  
Triples: 6  
Homeruns: 30  
Walks: 40  
Hit-by-Pitches: 5  
Sacrifice-Flies: 8

Output all three values OBP, SLG, and OPS on three different lines so all tests pass.  
It is okay to have more decimal places than the test is looking for (only 3).

**INFO:** Any OPS over .900 is considered great (i.e. Josh Donaldson had .939 the year he won the MVP for the Blue Jays, although Mike Trout had a .991 that year)

- The image below shows the final expected output:

### Instructions:
-   Clone this repository to your local machine, make changes in CLion so all tests pass, and then commit and push the entire project up to GitHub
-   You should then be able to see your raw score on GitHub out of 10 as shown in class. The final grade will depend on the time of submission, see below:

#### Marking Scheme
Final Grade | Requirement
:---: | ---
|**10/10** | Exercise is correct (passes all tests) and is completed within the allotted in-class time.
|**8/10** | Exercise is correct (passes all tests) and is completed within a 12-hour grace period beginning immediately following the end of in-class time.
|**6/10** | Exercise is correct (passes all tests) and is completed and submitted after the 12-hour grace period has elapsed.
|**0/10** | Exercise is not submitted or does not pass all tests.

# PROG 2007 - Exercise 11

## Task
We will use a version of this week's sample code to perform some user-selected bit operations.

### STEPS:
You have already been provided with "**src/main.c**", "**src/binOps.c**" and "**inc/binOps.h**" files. The binOps.h/binOps.c files already contains a function to output an integer as a binary string. The main.c file is mostly blank at present but does link in the binOps.h header file.

**Now, implement the code marked by "TODO's" in main.c.**

### Sample outputs:

Sample of Bitwise AND:

Sample of Bitwise OR:

Sample of Bitwise XOR:

Sample of Right Shift:

Sample of Bad Operator:

### Instructions:
-   Clone this repository to your local machine, make changes in CLion so all tests pass, and then commit and push the entire project up to GitHub
-   You should then be able to see your raw score on GitHub out of 10 as shown in class. The final grade will depend on the time of submission, see below:

#### Marking Scheme
Final Grade | Requirement
:---: | ---
|**10/10** | Exercise is correct (passes all tests) and is completed within the allotted in-class time.
|**8/10** | Exercise is correct (passes all tests) and is completed within a 12-hour grace period beginning immediately following the end of in-class time.
|**6/10** | Exercise is correct (passes all tests) and is completed and submitted after the 12-hour grace period has elapsed.
|**0/10** | Exercise is not submitted or does not pass all tests.
